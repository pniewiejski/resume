# My CV template

This project is based on the **AltaCV** class. See the template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/altacv-template/trgqjpwnmtgv).

> Leonardo was talking about a [résumé of Marissa Mayer that Business Insider put together](http://www.businessinsider.my/a-sample-resume-for-marissa-mayer-2016-7/) using [enhancv.com](https://enhancv.com).
> I _knew_ I had to do something about it. And so AltaCV was born.

## Requirements and Compilation

From the template's README:

> * pdflatex + biber + pdflatex
> * AltaCV uses [`fontawesome`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome) and [`academicons`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/academicons); they're included in both TeX Live 2016 and MikTeX 2.9.
> * Loading `academicons` is optional: enable it by adding the `academicons` option to `\documentclass`.
> * Use the `normalphoto` option to get a normal (i.e. non-circular) photo.
> * Use the `ragged2d` option to activate hyphenations while keeping text left-justified; line endings will thus be less jagged and more aesthetically pleasing.
> * Can now be compiled with pdflatex, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX!
> * However if you're using `academicons`, you _must_ use either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. If the doc then compiles but the icons don't show up in the output PDF, try compiling with LuaLaTeX instead.
> * The samples here use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font.
