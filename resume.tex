\cvsection[page1sidebar]{Profile}
I'm a person that seeks out opportunities to further my knowledge about the world.
I enjoy the process of figuring out how things work. In my professional life,
this translates to a willingness to take up tasks that I have not done before.
Inspired by my mentors I try to embrace the idea of extreme ownership and put it to work in my day-to-day efforts.

\cvsection{Experience}
\cvevent{Software Developer}{Future Processing}{December 2018 -- Present}{Gliwice, Poland}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Since September 2020 I have worked in the publishing domain, developing features for
    a microservice oriented application which enables users to share early research results.

        having a direct contact with the customer.

        for an embedded platform based on Android.
        \item In early 2020 I became the teamâ€™s lead-developer and as such my responsibilities
        were to plan and coordinate work of the development team, oversee onboarding of new

        issues were concerned.
